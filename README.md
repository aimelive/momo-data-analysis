#Team Name:DEVSQUAD
#Project Description

This project is a fullstack application that takes MoMo SMS data in XML format, cleans and organizes it, then stores it in a database. The system categorizes transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and payments, making the data easier to understand. On top of that, it provides a simple dashboard interface where users can explore charts and insights to analyze their financial activity.
